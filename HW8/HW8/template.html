    <h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis Map</h1>
    <h2>Nicholas Sheets</h2>
    <h3> In this map, I used geoprocessing analysis tools in order to answer the question "how many major waterways are 
        exposed to oil or gas wells. In order to do this, I imported data for both major rivers in Pennsylvania and oil/gas wells
        in Pennsylvania. Then I used the buffer tool to create a 300 foot buffer surrounding each well to account for potential
        pollution and other harmful affects associated with natural gas wells. Then I used the "interect" feature to see how many 
        rivers overlapped with these potential hazardous buffer zones created by the wells. In the map we see that there is a heavy 
        concentration of intersections in Western Pennsylvania, which there has historically been a lot of mining and now fossil fuel
        production.
